# Dots-Attack
Prototype of simple top down game.

WASD - control.
mouse left click-  shoot.
Reload - R or mouse left click if ammo is 0. 
Space - Dash.

Player need kill 30 dots to win the game.
Lose game when will be more than max dots.

There are two types of dots:
Green - Prize dot that has 7 health points and don't give you point but you get random good and bad mutator. 
White - Normal Dot that has 3 health and grand to you 1 point.

Every 5 points on map respown one green dot.

-------------------------------
Reset and new game doesn't work - game need to be restared to play

Don't have quit game or pause on esc - you need to alt + f4

This is demo and have too many problems to be fully functional.
Game was made months ago and i can't read this mess.
Should be lesson to make more documentation or create simple maps to achive goals.
